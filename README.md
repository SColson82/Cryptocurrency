# Unsupervised Machine Learning: Cryptocurrency Clustering ðŸ’±
<hr>

### Challenge: In this project, I have been given a data set of cryptocurrencies and asked to create a report that includes only those cryptocurrencies that are on the trading market and can be classified into groups to offer as different portfolios for new investment options. 
<hr>

* I started with a dataset of over 1200 cryptocurrencies but after filtering out the product that was not being traded and the product that was no longer being "mined" I was left with 532 different currencies.

* In order to evaluate whether these could be clustered I chose to use an unsupervised machine learning model and used Label Encoding to convert all of the available data to numeric. I used Lable Encoding rather than One-Hot Encoding to decrease the size of the DataFrames being created while still retaining all of the data in the numeric format.

* Once this was completed, the data was scaled using Standard Scaler. 

* Dimensionality was then reduced using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and then data clustering using t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) was completed. K-Means, to determine the optimal NUMBER of clusters was then applied to the data.

## Conclusions: The data CAN be clustered using these methods and the optimal number of clusters appears to be 4.

# ðŸ’¹ But which currencies should be clustered together in each portfolio option?
<hr>

* Once it was determined that not only can the data be clustered but it can be clustered into 4 different portfolio options the question became WHICH cryptocurrencies are best suited to be clustered together?

* To answer this question I created a new data frame consisting of the cryptocurrency names, t-SNE clustering information and a new column of the K-Means classifications to create four separate DataFrames; each consisting of the cryptocurrencies best suited to be included in that investment portfolio.
